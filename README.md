# CO2-EMISSIONS-IN-CANADA

INTRODUCTION
This analysis aims to explore the relationship between vehicle characteristics and CO2 emissions in Canada. Using a dataset containing information on vehicle, make, model, engine specifications, fuel type, and fuel consumption, we will investigate the factors influencing CO2 emissions. By examining trends and patterns within the data, this analysis seeks to identify potential areas for reducing carbon footprint in the Canadian automotive sector.

transmission
A = Automatic
AM = Automated manual
AS = Automatic with select shift
AV = Continuously variable
M = Manual

Fuel type
X = Regular gasoline
Z = Premium gasoline
D = Diesel
E = Ethanol (E85)
N = Natural gas

OBSERVATIONS AND FINDINGS
1. most of the car makers are ford followed by chevrolet, bmw, mercedes benz, others.
2. The car model preferences are F-150 FFFV with the highest, followed by F-150 FFV 4X4, MUSTANG, FOCUS FFV, and others.
3. the most used vehicle class was SUV-SMALL, MID-SIZE,COMPACT,SUV-STANDARD, and others.
4. The overwhelming majority of vehicles have automatic transmissions. This reflects consumer preferences for ease of driving, especially in urban environments.
5. The most common fuel type is regular gasoline, which may indicate cost considerations for consumers. The presence of premium gasoline vehicles suggests a niche market for performance-oriented or luxury vehicles.
6. Most vehicles have engine sizes between 2 and 4 liters, which is typical for modern vehicles aiming for a balance between power and fuel efficiency.
7. The data shows that fuel consumption in the city is generally higher than on the highway, which is typical due to stop-and-go traffic conditions. This insight can help consumers make informed decisions based on their driving habits.
8. The distribution of CO2 emissions indicates that most vehicles emit between 200-250 g/km. This information is crucial for understanding the environmental impact of the vehicle fleet and can inform policy decisions regarding emissions standards.
9. Factors that contribute to CO2 emissions highly are:
a. engine size
b. Cylinders
c. Fuel consumption city
d. Fuel consumption highway
e. Fuel consumption comb
